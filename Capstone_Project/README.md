  <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Yarmin Reyes</strong>. Happy you stopped by to check out this project my team and I built. When I first pitched the idea for this project, I didn't know my team would accept it with open arms. It was a pleasure to share the challenge of bringing this vision to life with individuals who's enthusiasm augmented my own.</p>

## The Dire Issue of Climate is Here and We *Need* Your Help!

This application breaks down how food and clothing waste have slipped by in the climate conversation. 
You make choices every day without realizing how you contribute to things like microplastics, coral bleaching, and rising temperatures across the globe.
We like to offer you some resources to find actionable answers to these issues.
Encourage your family and friends to join you! We've created profiles to help you keep track of your climate proficiency. 
Which of your squalls is in the know?

While this is only a capstone project these are very serious issues in society today.
I will provide links to sources and credit organizations and published literature cited throughout this project.

### Resources for Change
This is [Chilli](https://www.chilli.club/ "chilli") an iOS application you can use for daily action reminders.


> Open the `Capstone_Project` Folder and take a look at the `README.md` file to contribute to the React Client Project.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
